Good job for Assignment 4.

Several comments as follows:
1. Import package please not use wildcard.
2. No need to use continue to exit current loop.
3. Declare a class please try to use interface.
4. Add javadoc for classes and comments for functions.
5. Function need to check if input is valid.
6. Add more UTs to cover more code lines and branches.
